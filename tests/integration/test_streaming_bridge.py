    Tests that the bridge between an async and a sync stage is streaming.
    It does this by creating a pipeline with an async producer that slowly
    yields items, and a sync consumer that slowly processes them.

    If the bridge is not streaming, the total time will be the sum of all
    delays in the producer, plus the sum of all delays in the consumer.
    (e.g., 4 * 0.1s + 4 * 0.1s = 0.8s).

    If the bridge is streaming, the operations can overlap, and the total
    time will be much less. It should be closer to the time it takes for
    the last item to get through the whole pipeline.
    (e.g., first item takes 0.2s, subsequent items add 0.1s each, so ~0.5s)
