    A factory function for creating a Do-While component.

    This component executes a 'body' pipeline at least once, and then
    repeatedly as long as a 'condition' is true.

    The body pipeline must take a single item as input and produce a single
    item as output. This output is then fed back into the condition and the
    next iteration of the body.

    Args:
        condition: A callable that takes an item and returns True if the
                   loop should continue, False otherwise.
        body: The Stage or Pipeline to execute in each iteration.
