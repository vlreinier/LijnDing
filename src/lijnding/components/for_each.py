    A factory function for creating a ForEach component.

    This component takes an item, extracts an iterable from it using a
    `selector` function, and then runs a sub-pipeline for each element
    in that iterable.

    The results from all runs of the sub-pipeline are collected into a single
    list, which is then yielded as the output of the stage.

    Args:
        pipeline: The Stage or Pipeline to execute for each element.
        selector: A function that takes the input item and returns an
                  iterable of elements to be processed.

    Returns:
        A Stage that, for each input item, yields a single list containing
        all the results from the sub-pipeline runs.
